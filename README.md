ESNext Generation Interactive Workshop

Javascript: The final frontier.

In this journey, we will explore the strange new worlds of ES6 Iterators and Generators.

We will seek out new ways to loop; new iterations.

We will boldly code what no one has coded before!
Prerequisites

Make sure you are using node.js >= 0.11.15 (or any version of iojs), otherwise your generator code may not execute correctly.
Getting Started

$ npm install -g esnext-generation
$ esnext-generation # or, shorter: esng

Select the first lesson using arrow keys, then press , and follow the prompts.
Help

Be sure to check your work first, which can often provide hints:

$ esnext-generation verify <your-file.js>
